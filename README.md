# Pseudocode Analysis Tool

## Overview

This tool is designed to analyze HTTP transactions and generate detailed pseudocode that reflects the server-side implementation. It leverages OpenAI's API to provide insights into how backend systems likely process requests and generate responses.

## Features

- Analyzes HTTP request and response pairs
- Generates detailed pseudocode representing server-side implementation
- Provides insights on data flow between client, server, and databases
- Identifies likely programming languages and frameworks used
- Highlights authentication, validation, and business logic

## How It Works

1. The tool captures HTTP transactions (request and response)
2. It sends the transaction data to OpenAI's API
3. The AI analyzes the transaction and generates detailed pseudocode
4. Results are presented as findings in your workflow

## Requirements

- OpenAI API key
- Caido or similar HTTP analysis tool that supports JavaScript extensions

## Setup

1. Add your OpenAI API key to the script in the `openaiApiKey` variable
2. Import the script into your workflow
3. Run the workflow against HTTP transactions you want to analyze

## Example Output

The tool provides analysis including:

- Detailed explanation of the API endpoint functionality
- Data flow diagrams or descriptions
- Server-side pseudocode with:
  - Input validation steps
  - Database queries
  - Authentication checks
  - Business logic
  - Response construction

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors:

- Verify your OpenAI API key is correct
- Check that you have access to the model specified in the script
- Ensure the HTTP transaction contains valid request and response data
